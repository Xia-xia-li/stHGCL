## Overview
The stHGCL is designed as a unified method for identifying spatial domains across both single-slice and multi-slice SRT datasets. To achieve an effective fusion of gene expression and spatial location, the method includes a spot-gene heterogeneous graph, a dual-stage encoder system, and a neighborhood-based contrastive learning module.
